# Mips notes

## TODO

* a program to add,sum,mul ints with user input [ok]

* run to two of my progs [ok]

* read loops in mips

* learn about function in mips(should start directly with them)


## Linked List

* [OBJ] make a simple list and print it  

* The diagonal slash in the last node stands for the value 
**null** which is how the last node shows that it has no successor.

*  When a **memory address** is used as a link between nodes of a data 
structure it is sometimes called a **pointer**. 

* A visit to every node of a data structure is called a **traversal**. 

* jr $ra ---> go back to the calling function

* jal label ---> go to the label function.
